## Development

1. Install the latest version of Unity3D (2019.1.2f1 at the time of writing) and `git` (see [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) if you don't already have it installed)
2. (on macOS only) Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if you haven't already done so) and run `brew install git-lfs` to install Git LFS
3. Open a terminal window and clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/zharry/Predator-and-Prey.git` into a directory of your choosing
4. Open Unity Hub and under the "Projects" tab, click on the "Add" button to browse and open the project
5. Once the Unity Editor is open, browse to the "Assets/Install" in the "Project" Window and install every Unity Package from there
6. At this point, there should be no more errors in the "Console" Window
7. In the Unity Editor, open the GitHub tools with "Window" > "GitHub"
8. In the settings Tab fill out the Git Configuration for your "Name" and "Email", then press "Save User"
9. Then on the top-right corner, click the "Account" or "Sign In" button and login with your GitHub credentials
